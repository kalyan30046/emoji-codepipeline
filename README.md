# code-pipeline-game
 we’ll build a emoji game  using HTML, JavaScript and CSS.  The code will live in GitHub (you can fork the repo provided).  We’ll then create and configure an S3 bucket for static website hosting.  And from there, we’ll create a CodePipeline that pulls from GitHub and deploys to the S3 bucket.
At the end, we have  to delete the resources (which should all be eligible for the Free Tier).
